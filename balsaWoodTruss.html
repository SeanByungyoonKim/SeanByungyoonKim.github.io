              <p>The “Balsa Wood Truss” was created for a project for the course MTE 219 (Mechanics of Deformable Solids).
                The objective of the project was to create the optimal design for a truss so that it would maximize the
                amount of mass the truss is able to support while also minimizing the mass of the actual truss. To create the design,
                the materials we were given to build and test the truss was a plate of balsa wood, wooden dowel pins and wood glue.
                The picture to the left shows what the final design for the truss looked like after construction. </p>
              <br>
              <p>To design the truss, preliminary designs were drawn by hand before the parts of the “Balsa Wood Truss” were drawn in AutoCAD.
                As well, preliminary stress analysis was conducted on the design to find out the maximum load the truss would be able to support
                 before collapsing. After the stress analysis was completed and it was deemed that the design passed the minimum constraints
                 (the truss should be able to hold 125 times its mass), the parts were laser cut from the plate of balsa wood and assembled
                 together with the dowel pins and wood glue. Once the design is fully assembled, the truss was taken for testing to confirm
                 that the design would be able to support the minimum load required to pass the constraints. The video below shows the truss
                  while it was being tested.   </p>
              <br>
              <p>The final results for our design when it was tested until failure showed that our design could hold up to 224 times its mass
                (approximately 11g) and was able to hold a mass of 2500g before failure. This was well above the class average (178.4 times its mass)
                 and thus the design performed well above expectations.  </p>
