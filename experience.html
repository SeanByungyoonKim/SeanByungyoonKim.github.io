              <p>IGNIS Innovation Inc. is a Canadian tech company that focuses on OLED technology. Their main products are a
                wide variety of technologies that focus on extending the lifespan of OLED pixels by correcting any pixels that
                have failed due to “burn in”. A “burn in” is what happens when a some of the previously shown images on the
                display still remain on the screen because some of the OLED pixels have not refreshed properly to a new image.
                Some examples of this technology are Intelligent | Pixel and Stability | Control. Their main office is located
                in Waterloo, Ontario where I worked in the Mechanical department as a Hardware Engineer.  </p>

              <p>As a Hardware Engineer at IGNIS, the main responsibility of my position was to work on various designs that were
                needed for internal test fixtures. These test fixtures were utilized by IGNIS to run analyze various panels to
                determine how well their technology has corrected the burned in OLED pixels  The main project during my term was
                designing a camera rig that could move in 3 axes (X, Y and Z) with aluminum profile, lead screws and servo motors.
                The type of camera that the camera rig could hold was the ELDIM Umaster-MS, although the camera rig was designed so that
                it could theoretically hold any camera by replacing the mounting plate. The camera rig was also motorized by the servo
                motors and were controlled via PLC and C# programs that I wrote which utilized the Modbus and .NET protocols.  </p>

              <p>Flex Ltd. (formerly Flextronics) is an American manufacturing company that focuses on
                manufacturing electronics for various companies (e.g. Ford Motor Company). They have multiple
                locations in countries such as Singapore, the United States and Canada. During my co-op term at Flex Ltd.
                I worked in the Test Systems Engineering department in Markham, Ontario. </p>

              <p>As a Test Systems Engineer at Flex, the main responsibility of my position was to develop various pieces of
                embedded software for the testing team. These programs were used to perform quality control on various automotive
                products such as overhead consoles and displays. As well, these programs also automated the testing process and
                removed any manual aspects of the quality control for those products. To create these programs, the languages that
                I used were C and LabVIEW while also utilizing data transfer protocols such as I2C and TCP/IP. Along with my main
                responsibility of embedded software development, my other responsibilities involved precision soldering custom PCBs
                and assembling test fixtures for the testing team. </p>

              <p>Synaptive Medical is a Canadian biomedical startup based in Toronto that creates products for neurosurgeons.
                Some of their products includes a neurosurgical robot that can be used as a microscope during neurosurgery
                (Brightmatter Drive) and a realistic brain that is used as training for neurosurgery (Brightmatter Simulate).
                During my co-op term at Synaptive Medical, I worked as a Systems Tester for the Brightmatter Drive product. </p>

              <p>As a Systems Tester at Synaptive Medical, the main project that I worked on was a test fixture that performed
                a life-cycle test on one of the internal switches of Brightmatter Drive. The test fixture is composed of custom
                3D printed parts, an Arduino, a photo interrupter and a servo motor. As well, the motion of the test fixture was
                written using C++, while the UI for the test fixture was written using Java. With the test fixture, approximately
                72 hours of manual testing were saved as the fixture helped to automate the test process. Along with that project,
                some of my other responsibilities involved daily testing of the Brightmatter Drive unit to find both hardware and
                software issues and assembling various fixtures for both the mechanical team and testing team. </p>

                During my co-op term at Ericsson, I worked as a Test Automation Software Designer. </p>

              <p>As a Test Automation Software Designer, my main responsibilities involved reporting on nightly test runs for their LTE network
                and diagnosing any problems that occurred during those tests. Some of the issues that I had to help diagnose and fix were hardware
                issues regarding the nodes the tests were run on and determining the reason why the throughput did not meet the minimum level for
                the test to pass. </p>
