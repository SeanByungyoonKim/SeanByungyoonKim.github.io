              <p>The “Embedded Frogger Game” was created for the final project of the course MTE 241 (Introduction to Computer Structures & Real-Time Systems).
                 The objective of the project was to create a game that could be played on the Keil MCB 1700 evaluation board and implement its peripherals as
                 part of the game while having multiple tasks simultaneously running within the game. For this project, the classic arcade game “Frogger” was
                 recreated with for the microcontroller board.   </p>

              <p>The main objective of the game “Frogger” is to control a frog from one side of the road to the other side while avoiding various hazards on
                the road such as cars and trucks. The objective of our “Embedded Frogger Game” is essentially the same, with the player being able to move
                backwards, forwards and sideways on the road to avoid obstacles. To control the frog, the player utilizes the joystick on the Keil board to
                move around and avoid the cars. If the frog ends up hitting one of the cars on the road, the player loses a life and has to start again from
                the beginning. The player has 3 lives which is indicated by the LEDs on the board and when all 3 lives are lost, the game is over and the board
                has to be reset if the player wants to play again. On the other hand, if the player succeeds in controlling the frog to the other side of the road,
                the game shows a victory screen and then restarts. Finally, the player is able to adjust the difficulty of the game by adjusting the potentiometer.
                The potentiometer is programmed to adjust the speeds of the cars on the road, making the games easier or harder depending on the speed change. </p>

              <p>To create the “Embedded Frogger Game”, the project was written in C for the game to work in an embedded environment. The game also utilizes
                  multiple tasks that makes up the game such as the task that controls the movements of the frog, the task that handles the cars on the road
                  as they move along the screen and a task that handles the graphics of the game overall. Finally, due to academic policies, the source code
                  for the game is not allowed to be published to the public (such as Github repos) but a preliminary design of the game can be seen to the left. </p>
