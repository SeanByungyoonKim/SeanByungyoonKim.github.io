        <p>A Storm of Swords is the third installment in George R.R. Martin’s fantasy series “A Song of Ice and Fire”. These novels
          are famous (and infamous) for their expansive universe, polarizing characters, chapters that tell the story from characters’
          points of view, and unexpected (occasionally unpopular) character deaths. For the viewers of the television adaptation by HBO,
          seasons 3 and 4 covers the key components of A Storm of Swords. Some of these key components include the Red Wedding, the Purple
          Wedding, Tyrion’s trial and the Battle at the Wall. The novel covers the best storylines within the series and is a very gripping
          read, even after a second reading (or viewing, for the show watchers). Personally, A Storm of Swords is my favourite installment
          in the series though it’s mainly because the story explores in detail the background of one of the most complicated characters
          in the series, Jaime Lannister.  </p>

        <p>To provide some literary context, Jaime Lannister was introduced as one of the greatest knights alive and bodyguard to the King,
          a very prestigious position for any knight. He is the eldest son and heir to the richest man in the Western world and is related to
          the royal family since his twin sister is the Queen. He is later revealed to have literally backstabbed the former king (aka the Mad
          King) during a civil war, engaged in incestous relationships with his twin sister, fathered all of the royal children (without the
          King’s knowledge) and pushed a seven year old off a tower. So overall, he’s not a great person. However, A Storm of Swords provides
          chapters from Jaime’s point of view that provides an interesting insight to the character as he goes through a fall from grace.  </p>

        <p>During the events of A Storm of Swords, the details of the Mad King’s death are revealed in Jaime’s chapters (some key
          details of the war are left mysteriously vague). According to Jaime’s recollection, the Mad King demanded that Jaime has to bring him
          his father and invader of the capital (Tywin Lannister) and that he would literally blow up the entire city, killing everybody in the
          process. This put Jaime at a crossroads, to kill his own father and let the King blow up the city or refuse the King and end the war
          with his actions. This revelation changes the perception of Jaime from an egocentric degenerate to a complicated person plagued by past
          decisions. The transformation of Jaime continues when as a prisoner of war, he gets his dominant hand chopped off due to his arrogance.
          Jaime becomes more reflective of himself as he realizes how little self-worth he has since he can no longer fight and how immoral he has
          become since his youth. The quote is an example of this as Jaime had once aspired to be like Arthur Dayne, one of the greatest and most
          honourable knight in the world. However, somewhere along the way, he had become like the Smiling Knight, a bandit notorious for his exceptional
          swordsmanship and immorality. The way that A Storm of Swords had completely changed my opinion of Jaime was the main reason why A Storm of
          Swords is my favourite book of the series and a credit to George R.R. Martin’s ability to create polarizing characters for the reader.  </p>
