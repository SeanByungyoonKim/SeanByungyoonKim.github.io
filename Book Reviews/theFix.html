        <p>Soccer is one of my favourite sports to play, watch and follow, but it’s never been much of a reading topic for me.
          I’ve never been very interested in books involving sports in the past but picked up “The Fix” after looking over the
          summary. The Fix is a recollection of a journalist’s investigations into match-fixing within the sport. Sadly, it is
          a poorly kept secret that there’s a fair bit of cheating that occurs within the sport (or sports in general) with one
          major example being the "Calciopoli" scandal that affected Serie A (the Italian league). However,
          research that looked into the aspect of the story had not reached an international scope before this novel, so for me,
          The Fix was an interesting read.</p>

        <p>The novel follows Declan Hill’s investigative journalism of match-fixing and corruption as he travelled the world for
          his research. The extent of his research ranged from obscure leagues in small Asian countries such as the Philippines,
          to the 2006 FIFA World Cup held in Germany (the biggest and most popular soccer event in the world). His research explains
          how match-fixing works, who benefits the most from match-fixing and why the players of the game would even agree to fix a
          match in the first place. The novel also explores how the players would go about fixing a match such as explaining the tactics
          used to going in-depth on how each player’s role could affect a fixed outcome. However, the novel has a pretty cynical message
          that the author tries to portray to the reader: corruption is apparent at every level in the sport, with this message being driven
          home into the match-fixing allegations at the World Cup, the highest level of the sport. Despite the cynical nature of the novel,
          The Fix is a novel that I greatly enjoyed due to the interesting subject matter and would recommend it to anybody that is even
          remotely interested in soccer. </p>
