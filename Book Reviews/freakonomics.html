        <p>For my first book in my “52 Books in 52 Weeks” challenge, Freakonomics isn’t exactly one of the books that I would generally read. The books that I
          usually enjoy reading features some kind of overarching narrative structure, connecting stories and an interesting plot (I also enjoy the occasional
          biography, though they’re generally an exception to the rule since it depends on how interesting the person was). Freakonomics on the other hand,
          encompasses a grand total of zero of these aspects. The closest aspect that the book contains is its interesting plot, although the authors pretty
          much dismiss the idea that there even is a plot within the introduction. However, even with these aspects (or lack thereof), Freakonomics has been
          one of the books that I’ve enjoyed reading the most this year (and yes, this is with the added benefit of hindsight approximately 30 books later).  </p>

        <p>Although the book lacks a cohesive plot, the authors do a good job in formulating some kind of story. Freakonomics can be regarded as a collection of
          short stories that explores the economics of a variety of “industries” (e.g. drug dealing, parenting, abortion). To explore these “industries”, the
          authors use comparisons in their attempt to find correlations and simplify their explanations to the average reader (e.g. comparing the KKK to real
          estate agents). All of these short stories involve an underlying message: statistical context is important. Many of the stories and comparisons written
          in the novel wouldn’t make much sense without the statistical context that the authors provide and is one of the most important takeaways from this book.
          Freakonomics is a book that I’d highly recommend to anybody looking for a well-written book about statistics in the most unexpected places (although
          frankly, there isn’t much talked about with regards to economics).     </p>
